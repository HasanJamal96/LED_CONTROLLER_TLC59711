# LED_CONTROLLER_TLC59711

 project is about using different modes for different scenarios of the day, which I want to present with 3 Buttons - 1 Button for every Mode.
  1. Fading certain LED channel's from 0-100%, if it's 100%, getting darker with every push of the Button till it's 0%. If it doesnâ€™t reach 0% it should increase back to       100%. 
  2. Fading 0 to 100% all LEDs and fading back off if the button gets pushed again.
  3. With every push, certain LED channel's should increase their volume by a random amount (so it's different each time). And getting slowly dimmed down if nothing is         pushed.
